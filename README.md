# Snake and Ladder Game (Python – AI Assisted)

This project is a Snake and Ladder game created using AI-assisted development with Antigravity.

I designed the game logic and features through structured prompts and validated the gameplay behavior locally.

## Project Overview
-player Snake and Ladder game
- Dice roll logic
- Predefined snakes and ladders
- Player movement based on dice value
- Win condition: exact 100

## How It Was Built
- Tool used: Antigravity (prompt-based development)
- Language: Python
- Approach: Prompt engineering + logic validation

## My Role
- Defined functional requirements for the game
- Created prompts to generate the game logic
- Validated game rules and flow
- Tested different scenarios (dice rolls, snake bites, ladder climbs)
- Suggested improvements to game behavior

## What I Learned
- Translating requirements into precise prompts
- Understanding Python game logic structure
- Validating AI-generated code behavior
- Debugging logic through testing and iteration

## Future Enhancements
- Add GUI using Tkinter
- Improve dice animation
- Add single-player mode vs computer

This project represents my hands-on learning with AI-assisted development and Python fundamentals.
